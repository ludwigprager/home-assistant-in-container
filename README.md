# Run home assistant in a container


**Rationale:**
The advantage of this solution as opposed to run `home assistant` natively
on your machine: you only need git and docker installed, it won't clutter your linux
installation.

It runs on raspberry and PC (and probably also on Mac)

# TL;DR

```
git clone https://github.com/ludwigprager/home-assistant-in-container.git
./home-assistant-in-container/start.sh
```

You need to install docker and git, nothing else.
So the advantage is that you won't clutter your installation.

FYI: I run home assistant with a sonoff zigbee stick.
